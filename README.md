# Notebookk


Notebookk is a daily note-taking application that allows you to create multiple notebooks and add as many notes to them as you like. The app is built on the Anvil platform using Python language. It uses the Quill editor to create notes, which offers multiple styling options such as text sizes, colours, and image pasting.

## Features

- Easily search text through the titles and content of your notes.
- Use the Quill editor to style your notes and add images, links, emojis, and many more.

Use the Quill editor toolbar to style your notes as desired, and when ready, click on "Save".

To share a notebook, click the three dots next to the notebook and then the "Share" button. Then, enter the email addresses of the users you want to add and select the permission you want to grant them, such as editing access or read-only. If the user exists, they will be added automatically.

When an added user logs in to Notebookk, they will see the shared notebook on their homepage. If they have editing access, they can add and edit notes in the shared notebook. If they have read-only access, they can only view the notes.
